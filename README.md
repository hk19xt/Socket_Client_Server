# Socket_Client_Server
This program is for implementing the application layer between a client and a server by using Java.

How to run the program:

1. Download the Lab1.zip folder.
2. For the question 1,
1) open a terminal window and use the command line as follows.
>> cd Lab1
>> ls
>> cd src
>> ls
>> cd Lab1_Q1
>> ls
>> java Server.java
After then, the message will come up like “Waiting for telnet client connection. Please open
another window to connect client.”
2) open another terminal window and use the command line as follows.
 >> telnet localhost 4000
After then, the message will be seen as “Trying 127.0.0.1… Connected to localhost.
Escape character is ‘^]’.” in the client window. Also, the message “The client and server are now
connected” in the server window.
3) Now, the client can send message in the client window, like “hi,” and the server will respond
like “Message from a client: hi.”


This program is conducted by the student only for the individual school assignment.
